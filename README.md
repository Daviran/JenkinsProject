# JenkinsProject
A small Jenkins Project made at Epitech : create a Jenkins instance that can automatically test repositories. 

## Goals of this project:
  - Discovery of Jenkins and JCasC
  - Discovery of Job DSL
  - Testing scripts


Disclaimer: Some of the commit message might be useless, as the grade for the project was given by automated tests, so some tweaks occured to match the automated test desire.
